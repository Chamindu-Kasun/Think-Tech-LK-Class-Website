## File Naming Convention

- Use the exact topic name as shown in the tutorials page
- Add `.pdf` extension
- Example: `What is ICT?.pdf`

## How It Works

1. Users click on a unit to see all topics
2. Each topic appears as a tile
3. Clicking a tile opens the corresponding PDF
4. PDFs open in a new browser tab

## Adding New PDFs

1. Create the unit folder if it doesn't exist
2. Add PDF files with exact topic names
3. The system will automatically find and load them
