      "question": "Consider the following statements P and Q: Which of the following is valid regarding the above two statements?<br>P – A qubit of a quantum computer can have a higher number of states than a bit of a traditional computer.<br>Q – Quantum computing promises to perform calculations, currently beyond traditional computer's reach, at incredible speeds.",
      "options": [
        {"id": "a", "text": "Both statements P and Q are correct and statement P gives the reason for Statement Q."},
        {"id": "b", "text": "Both Statements P and Q are correct but the points presented in the two statements are not related."},
        {"id": "c", "text": "Statement P is correct but statement Q is incorrect."},
        {"id": "d", "text": "Statement P is incorrect but statement Q is correct."},
        {"id": "e", "text": "Both statements P and Q are incorrect"}
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "Both statements are correct and related. P is true - qubits can exist in superposition of states (0 and 1 simultaneously), enabling more states than classical bits. Q is true - this property allows quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster, and P explains why Q is possible."
